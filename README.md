## Summary

A PMI and ITIL certified software engineer and project manager with over 20 years of enterprise Java software development experience in leadership positions. I have a proven track record of getting things done in dynamic environments with rapidly shifting priorities. I am equally at home in technical discussions, solving complex problems in front of the whiteboard or the keyboard, and working directly with stakeholders to understand their business and their needs in order to provide them with real, lasting technology solutions. I am seeking a position that will challenge me to make use of both my broad technical and project leadership skills.
